# Clojure Embedded Event Processing

eep-clj consists of two parts first one is a lightweight generic Event Handling system,
and second one is windowed steam operations.

eep-clj have started as an initiative after other EEP projects:

  * [eep-js (JavaScript)](https://github.com/darach/eep-erl)
  * [eep-erl (Erlang)](https://github.com/darach/eep-erl)
  * [eep-php (PHP)](https://github.com/ianbarber/eep-php)

# Project status

This is a thought experiment, API can change at any moment. Nothing is considered stable
or final. We keep modifying, improving things in order to provide best, Clojuric way to
handle events and streams.

# Event Emitter

Idea and API of Event Emitter was inspired by Erlang [gen_event behavior](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gen_event.html)

Event order is guaranteed. In order to verify that all the pending operations are done by certain point,
you can use `flush-futures` function. It's a synchronous operation, and may take an unpredictable amount
of time, depending on the contention.
